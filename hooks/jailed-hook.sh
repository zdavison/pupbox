# Reads the list of commands to jail from (in order):
#   1. $JAILED_CONFIG (for tests / one-off overrides)
#   2. $HOME/.config/jailed/commands
#   3. Built-in fallback (python3 python jq awk sed grep)
#
# Rewrite strategy: at shell-token boundaries (start-of-string, or after
# |, &, ;, `, $(, (, {), prepend `jailed ` to any listed command. This
# handles pipelines, &&, and $(...) naturally. It does NOT handle:
#   - env FOO=bar python3 (command is not at token boundary)
#   - commands embedded inside single-quoted strings that themselves
#     contain shell separators (e.g. `echo ';python3'`) — false positive
# The rewrite is an `allow` + `updatedInput` output, so Bash runs the
# substituted command without an approval prompt.
